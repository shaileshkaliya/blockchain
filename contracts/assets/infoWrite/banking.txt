Steps to Implement Banking Transactions:
Smart Contract in Solidity: This will define the logic for creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds.
Web3.js Integration: The frontend will use Web3.js to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling interaction with the smart contract and MetaMask.
MetaMask: It will be used to sign transactions and interact with the blockchain securely.
1. Smart Contract in Solidity
Below is the Solidity code for the bank contract that allows users to create accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and transfer money between accounts.

Explanation of the Solidity Contract:
register: Registers the account, allowing the user to interact with the contract.
deposit: Allows the user to deposit Ether into their account.
withdraw: Allows the user to withdraw Ether from their account.
transfer: Transfers Ether from one registered user to another.
getBalance: Returns the balance of the calling user.
2. Web3.js Integration
Now, you'll need a frontend application that interacts with the deployed contract using Web3.js and MetaMask. The steps are as follows:

Connect to MetaMask.
Initialize Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
Interact with the contract's functions (deposit, withdraw, transfer).

Explanation of the Frontend Code:
MetaMask and Web3.js: MetaMask is used to connect the user's Ethereum wallet to the application. Web3.js provides the connection between the frontend and the Ethereum blockchain.
registerAccount: Calls the register() function of the contract to register the user.
depositFunds: Allows the user to deposit Ether to their account. It asks for the amount and sends the Ether to the contract.
withdrawFunds: Allows the user to withdraw Ether from their account.
transferFunds: Allows the user to transfer Ether to another address.
getBalance: Fetches and displays the user's current balance.
3. Deploying the Smart Contract
Compile the Solidity Contract using an online tool like Remix or using the Solidity compiler in your local environment.
Deploy the Contract to an Ethereum test network like Rinkeby or Ropsten (you can use MetaMask to deploy the contract).
Update the contract address and ABI in your frontend code once the contract is deployed.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to implement a banking transaction system using Ethereum smart contracts with Solidity, MetaMask, and Web3.js. The system allows users to register, deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between users in a decentralized manner. By leveraging the power of blockchain, transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable.
